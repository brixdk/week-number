  <h1>Privacy Policy for Week Number</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 12, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Week Number is a Chrome extension designed to integrate with your Google Calendar to only read events and give a conveniently calendar overview. 
    This Privacy Policy explains how the extension handles your data and your privacy rights.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data access and usage</h2>
  <p>
    The extension requests <strong>read-only access</strong> to your Google Calendar through Google's secure OAuth 2.0 authorization system. 
    This access allows Week Number to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Read calendar events to determine and display week numbers accurately.</li>
    <li>Read your Google Calendar settings (such as start of the week and time format preferences) to match your configuration.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Week Number <strong>does not</strong> and <strong>cannot</strong> modify, delete, or create any events in your calendar.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data storage</h2>
  <p>
    The extension stores only minimal settings locally in your browser (e.g., your preferred start of the week and 12/24-hour format).
    This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any external server.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Week Number does not share, sell, or transmit any user data to third parties. 
    All data access is performed securely and solely within the context of your Chrome browser.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Week Number uses Google’s official OAuth 2.0 authentication flow, ensuring that your credentials are never handled or stored by the extension. 
    Data is processed using secure Chrome Extension APIs.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Updates will be published on this page with a new "Last updated" date.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
