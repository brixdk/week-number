  <h1>Terms of Service for Week Number</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 12, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of terms</h2>
  <p>
    By installing or using the Week Number Chrome extension, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. 
    If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the extension.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Use of the extension</h2>
  <p>
    Week Number is provided for personal use to integrate with your Google Calendar and display week numbers in a calendar view. 
    You may use the extension only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these terms.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data access</h2>
  <p>
    The extension requests read-only access to your Google Calendar via OAuth 2.0 to determine week numbers. 
    It stores minimal user settings locally (e.g., start of the week, 12/24-hour preference). 
    No other data is collected or transmitted.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
  <p>
    The extension is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. 
    Week Number does not guarantee accuracy of week numbers or compatibility with all devices.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>
    In no event shall the developers of Week Number be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of the extension.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms of Service at any time. Updates will be published on this page. Continued use of the extension constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
